Real-Time Object Measurement using OpenCV in Python

Overview
This repository contains a Python implementation for real-time object measurement using the OpenCV library. The project is designed to accurately measure the dimensions of objects captured through a camera feed. It is particularly useful for applications such as augmented reality, computer vision, and industrial automation.

Features
Real-Time Measurement: Utilizes OpenCV to process video frames in real-time, providing instant and accurate measurements of objects within the camera's field of view.

Automatic Calibration: Implements automatic calibration to ensure accurate scaling, allowing users to obtain precise measurements in various scenarios.

User-Friendly Interface: Displays the measurements on the video feed in a user-friendly manner, making it easy to understand and integrate into other applications.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

Python 3.x
OpenCV (cv2
pip install opencv-python
Usage
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/Anandkijai/Real-time-object-measurement.git
cd Real-time-object-measurement
Run the object measurement script:
python Real-time-object-measurement.py
Adjust the camera settings and ensure proper lighting for optimal results.
Configuration
Customize the behavior of the object measurement system by adjusting parameters in the config.py file. Parameters such as camera calibration settings, measurement units, and display options can be modified based on your specific use case.
